# Hangman

The classic game of hangman recreated as a console application using Python. 

## Description

The program first randomly chooses a word to be between four and seven letters, and then randomly picks a one word out of the top five hundred with that letter. The program then tells the user how many letters there, and the user will guess begin to guess the letters of the word until they figure out what it is.

If you guess a letter correctly, you will get a congratulatory message, and your letter will show up.

But if you guess incorrectly. you will be notified, and the "hanged man" will start forming on the noose.

## Winning & Losing

In order to win, you meed to guess all the letters in the word before the entirety of the hanged man is formed. Doing so you will give you congratulatory message, and the complete worded will be printed just to remind you. However you may lose as well if the entired hanged man is formed. You will recieve a pity message, and you will be told what the word actually was.

## Other Notes

Thank you for checking this out and playing! Feel free developers to contribute to this project because the code is *far* from perfect and it was mainly made to get back into the groove of using python. Enjoy!
